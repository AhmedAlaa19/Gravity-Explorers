an Educational Game about the Solar system 
made with the unity engine 
details:  
the game is an endless runner that contains multiple levels 
and each level (Planet) teaches the player a new thing about said planet 
and each level contains its own gravity which adds the twist and ties the game's title, theme, aand gameplay.
still needs some tiny game design work but other than that its done.
